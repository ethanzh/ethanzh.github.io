# What did you do this past week?
This week we obviously had the final stretch for phase 2 of our project. This involved a lot of work, I particularly worked on the data collection, cleaning, and infrastructure. The biggest time-sink was using Elastic Beanstalk, it requires a lot of investigation to see why containers fail to spin up properly (in our case due to OOM). We thought we had already finished setting up the backend because we had an ECS/Fargate instance up and running but it was unclear how to add TLS to that.
# What's in your way?
Halloweekend definitely set me back a little bit, school-wise. I'm hoping to take the next week to refocus on school and hopefully get a lot done on our project. Hopefully other than that there is not much in my way.
# What will you do next week?
Next week I'm going to try to run a few times. I've been pretty good about it lately but I want to make sure I establish the routine. Additionally I will also work on phase 3 of our project for this class.
# If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #10: Dependency Inversion Principle?
This one I actually thought was a little bit more relevant than some of the other papers we've read. I still think I need to see a much larger example to truly appreciate the benefits of these paradigms.
# What was your experience of =, *, ** and regular expressions? (this question will vary, week to week)
I had already known about =, * and ** but it was interesting to discuss them in-depth with the proper terminology. I still do not fully understand regular expressions and need to put more time into learning about how to use them.
# What made you happy this week?
I went to Cabo Bob's. That is generally a pretty easy way to make me happy.
# What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
[This](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/commemoration/EWD-commemoration-2021.pdf#page4) is a really interesting collection of anecdotes about Edsgar Dijkstra from many different famous computer scientists.
