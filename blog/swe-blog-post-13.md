# What did you do this past week?
This week I actually got a ton of work done at my job which has been really nice because normally I feel perpetually behind while trying to balance coursework and extracirricular activities. We also finished Phase 3 of our project, and honestly it was a little bit of a shitshow. Our Elastic Beanstalk deployment broke at the last moment and the logs made it very unclear what was happening (it turns out that someone forgot to commit a new dependency to our requirements.txt file). I'm a bit frustrated with how hard it is to parse Elastic Beanstalk logs, but I guess you're ideally mean to pipe those logs to CloudWatch or something like that.
# What's in your way?
I'm pretty sure I have the flu. I woke up at 7am both extremely hot and extremely cold. I've been chugging tons of water today and taking it easy but I still feel generally weak. I'm trying to get a flu test ASAP so I can get the antiviral meds but it has been very difficult to schedule a flu test.
# What will you do next week?
This next week we are going to refactor the hell out of our codebase, especially the React app. There are definitely places where we copy/pasted code for the sake of speed rather than taking a few moments to form reasonable abstractions. Obviously this could have been solved by working on the project sooner rather than later but I think we all know that somehow always ends up not being the case.
# If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #13: Why Extends Is Evil?
I prefered this reading to the long-form C++ OOP posts we've been reading the past few weeks. I suppose this essay was very Java-centric, again I would have preferred to read something more focused on Python (which has several ways of implementing interfaces) rather than Java, even though we all know Java from 314.
# What was your experience of SQL?
I thought the Hackerrank exercises were pretty fun to do. I had already written lots of SQL at my job but I learned a few new things such as USING vs ON when performing joins.
# What made you happy this week?
We played our final rugby match of the season against UTSA and won 32-30. I only played for the last 10 minutes or so but I had a blast and had several solid tackles and carries, including a jackal (basically stealing the ball fron the other team).
# What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
I thought [this](https://www.washingtonian.com/2021/11/09/how-gen-z-and-the-tiktok-generation-are-becoming-spies/) was an interesting article discussing the CIA attempting to recruit Gen Z'ers. Some really interesting tid bits in there.
