## Where did you grow up?
I moved around a lot growing up. I was born and raised for several years in Norway, before moving to Beijing, China for my first three years of high school. I moved to Palo Alto, California for my senior year of high school.
## What high school did you attend?
International School of Beijing and Gunn High School
## What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?
Nothing beats playing rugby.
## Why did you come to UT?
I was picking between UT and UCSB, and I figured if I went to UCSB I would just lounge on the beach all day so UT seemed like the more pragmatic choice. I'm also a 3rd (4th maybe?) generation Longhorn which did factor a little into the decision.
## Why are you majoring in CS?
I've been programming for more than half of my life at this point, but I was actually very torn on what to major in. Eventually it came down to CS, economics, or film. Moving to Palo Alto for my senior year of high school really nudged me in the CS direction though, and I'm glad it did.
## Why are you in this class?
I'd be lying if I said the writing flag wasn't a big factor. That being said I was also excited at being able to take a more application-driven course rather than theory-driven.
## What are your expectations of this class?
My expectation is that we are going to build a fully-featured web app with a random(ish) group to us. I think the PM-ish aspect of the projects is going to play a greater role than a lot of people think.
## How much Javascript/Python/SQL/Web programming do you already know?
A lot. I'm maybe a little behind on what the current React trends are, but I'm very confident in my Python/SQL abilities. 
## How did you like the first lectures?
Nothing too out of the ordinary. I'm honestly still a little suspiscious of the black-box AI paper grading, but I guess we'll see how that goes. Excited to dig into the projects!
## How did you feel about the cold calling?
It's a non-issue, I honestly don't think it's a big deal at all.
## What made you happy this week?
The building I live in finally fixed my AC.
## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Anyone who's spent a large amount of time writing Python is eventually going to run into type issues. [Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org) is a step in the right direction for solving these issues. However this week I came across [this](https://andrewbrookins.com/technology/building-implicit-interfaces-in-python-with-protocol-classes/) article that describes how to attain Golang-like interfaces in Python. To me this is huge and I can't wait to incorporate it into my own projects.
