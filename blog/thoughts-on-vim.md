Pros
Customization
Ability to edit anywhere, especially remote
Steep learning curve, large payoff

Cons
Customization
Difficulty in keeping consistent across machines
    vimrc each, PlugIn managers not so much

Moving towards more minimal vimrc

Go through vimrc every now and then
    If I don't remember what it does, chunk it

Not a replacement for an IDE
    Possible to try, but not worth it in my opinion
