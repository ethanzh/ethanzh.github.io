Wasn't able to dedicate time to writing thoughtful posts before

COVID-19 gave free time to redesign site
    Focus on minimalism

Don't be a perfectionist with posts. Better to get ideas out there
than fester forever

Want posts to be a combination of tech-focused musings,
tutorials for non-trivial things I figure out. Social commentary
if I'm up for it.
