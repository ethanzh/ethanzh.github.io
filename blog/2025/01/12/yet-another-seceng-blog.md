This is not the first time over the years that I've tried to "start blogging".
Maybe this is the time it sticks!

I can't keep letting perfect be the enemy of good. Of course you want a piece
of writing to have some amount of polish before you show it to the world, but
it's also easy to take that too far and then never release anything.

I intend to write primarily about things related to my role as the first security
engineer at a growing startup. This includes developing secure software, hiring and
growing teams, and owning corporate security.
