# What did you do this past week?
I did a lot of stuff this week. On Friday I drove to Dallas to play against OU in rugby and then go to the state fair the next day to watch the football game. Then I drove back to Austin to go to ACL which was a blast. I also got my COVID booster shot!
# What's in your way?
I did not get a ton of my work done as a result of going to OU/ACL. I'm looking forward to getting back on track this week. I also have a few midterms next week which I am hoping will not be too bad.
# What will you do next week?
As said, i'm going to try to get back into my regular routine. I actually have have a midterm on Monday also which I've hopefully sutdied enough for. Finally, we are going to start actually scraping data from our RESTful APIs to get started on phase 2 of the project. I will also try to go for a few farther runs to work on my cardio.
# If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #7: Open-Closed Principle?
It was an interesting read but I honestly thought it was pretty straightforward. I think it made some interesting point about dogmatic practices, such as always avoiding global variables no matter what. I'll probably need to read it a few more times to be able to really internalize it.
# What was your experience of operators, and iteration?
I thought we got pretty in-the-weeds, which was interesting but I've really never had to think about any of these specifics while writing Python code generally. I didn't know about the differneces between iterables and iterators before.
# What made you happy this week?
I had a ton of fun with my friends in Dallas, and also we beat OU in rugby! Also I finally finished my Networks project which was a stressor in my life. This next week will be even better because I'll be able to get back into my normal routine.
# What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
[This](https://www.softwareatscale.dev/p/software-at-scale-34-faster-python) is an intersting interview with the creator of Python discussing ways to increase the speed at which the langauge runs.
