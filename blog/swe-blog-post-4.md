## What did you do this past week?
I got a lot of stuff done this week. I've settled into my routine a lot more and have been really happy with the progress I've made.
## What's in your way?
Unfortunately my building's fire alarm went off during class on Friday! I had to walk down and then up 20 flights of stairs which was kind of a bummer.
## What will you do next week?
Next week is going to be more of the same! On Friday I'll also be travelling to U of H for our rugby game against them.
## If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #4: What Happens to Us?
It's of course a shocking reality check to a lot of us how unwelcoming our field can be to people that come from different backgrounds than we do. Of course it's a reminder that it is all of our responsibility to make strides in the right direction regarding gross behavior in the field as described in the article.
## What was your experience of Collatz, exceptions, and types? (this question will vary, week to week)
I thought Collatz was a nice first project for this class, but I'm excited to move more into a full-stack project. It was also interesting to do a bit of a deep dive into exception handling. I think I like Python's exception system, but I'm not sure if I prefer Go's strategy of passing errors as values, rather than as control flow operators. The discussions regarding types were also interesting -- I think Mypy is a very valuable tool.
## What made you happy this week?
We had our first rugby scrimmage on Friday! We just played against ourselves but we treated it like a proper game. I got away with no serious injuries which is always nice! Also I got to see UT take a decisive victory over Rice on Saturday night.
## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Dijkstra is one of the more famous professor's that have taught at UT. [Here](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/commemoration/EWD-commemoration-2021.pdf#page4) is an interesting commemoration in his honor with a lot of anecdotes with him. He sure seems like a character.
