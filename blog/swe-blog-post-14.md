# How well do you think the course conveyed those takeaways?
I think it conveyed them decently.
# Were there any other particular takeaways for you?
I did not like how the projects were totally disconnected from the lectures.
# How did you feel about cold calling?
It was fine I didn't feel too strongly about it. 
# How did you feel about specifications grading?
I did not like it.
# How did you feel about help sessions and office hours?
I went to one help session it was pretty helpful
# How did you feel about the support from the TAs?
I thought they were great!
# What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?
I had honestly used many of these tools before so there wasn't much new that I found.
# What's the most helpful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?
The React debugger
# How did you feel about your group having to self-teach many, many technologies?
I didn't like it. I know that software engineers need to self-teach many tools but it honestly felt like a waste to not be taught them properly. I am sure many groups had to self-teach React and taught themselves poorly. I would way rather learn React properly than getting into the nitty-gritty details of Python.
# Give me your suggestions for improving the course, but apologies in advance; specifications grading will remain.
