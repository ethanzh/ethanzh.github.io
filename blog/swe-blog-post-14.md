# How well do you think the course conveyed those takeaways?
I think the class conveyed the above points appropriately but I still am not really sure what I got out of this class. Sure we talked about containers/iterators/iterables but that really just felt like a rehash of data structures, I kind of wished a software engineering class would've talked more about actual real world tools and best practices rather than just drilling into intricacies of Python.
# Were there any other particular takeaways for you?
I did not like how the projects were totally disconnected from the lectures. I think it was a huge missed oppurtunity for us to not learn about the tools in class.
# How did you feel about cold calling?
It was fine I didn't feel too strongly about it. It's a good way to make sure people are paying attention I suppose.
# How did you feel about specifications grading?
I hated the specifications grading. I could probably rant about this for hours, I do not see the upside of it.
# How did you feel about help sessions and office hours?
I went to one help session it was pretty helpful. The night projects were due were always pretty stressful so I'm especially thankful for Jefferson helping our team out.
# How did you feel about the support from the TAs?
I thought they were great! Like I said above, Jeff was a huge help to our group. That being said, at a certain point it is difficult for the TAs to be helpful with the projects because everything gets very project-specific, especially in the React apps, and even the Flask backends.
# What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?
I had honestly used many of these tools before so there wasn't much new that I found. I guess Flask-Restless was kind of helpful but also ended up being a bit more of a pain than a help.
# What's the most helpful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?
The React debugger helps immensely when building the frontend.
# How did you feel about your group having to self-teach many, many technologies?
I didn't like it. I know that software engineers need to self-teach many tools but it honestly felt like a waste to not be taught them properly. I am sure many groups had to self-teach React and taught themselves poorly. I would way rather learn React properly than getting into the nitty-gritty details of Python.

Quite honestly, I paid several thousand dollars to take this class and I really don't agree that the class should be us teaching ourselves an overly prescribed list of tools, some of which were less helpful than others.
# Give me your suggestions for improving the course, but apologies in advance; specifications grading will remain.
Make the lectures more applicable. They were kind of interesting sometimes but I felt I didn't get a whole lot out of them. I honestly still cannot wrap my head around the specifications grading. It makes people think way more about the grading system than a normal 0-100% scale. The professor mentioned specifications grading is good because "everyone can get an A" but that is true with the 0-100% scale as well.
