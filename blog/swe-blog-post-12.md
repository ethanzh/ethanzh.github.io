# What did you do this past week?
I did a lot in this past week. I did not get a whole lot done on the SWE project but we are definitely going to be able to grind it out these next two days. I mostly did a lot of stuff at work to catch-up because I was a little sick the week before. It will be nice to have finally finished phase 3!
# What's in your way?
My birthday was this weekend and I am still kind of recovering from my party and the football game the next day. Should be all good to go on Monday! I also wish we would have beat Kansas in football but you can't have everything.
# What will you do next week?
As said this week we will finish phase 3 of our SWE project in all liklihood. I am also starting a course called Crypto College which I am interested to take to learn more about Web 3.0 and NFTs.
# If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #12: More Getters and Setters?
I'm going to be totally honest this was a really dry paper. I get what it's saying but it was a little hard to really relate to the content as it uses old Java UI APIs that I've never heard of. I would be really curious to see a similar essay but for Python because I think that would make it easier to digest.
# What was your experience of cross join, theta join, natural join, and SQL?
I've done a lot of work with SQL in the past to the syntax was nothing new but it was interesting to learn more about the different types of joins and what is happening under the hood in each case. It was particularly interesting to implement the joins in Python code.
# What made you happy this week?
Celebrating my birthday this weekend made me very happy! Additionally the weather is now getting cooler which is very much welcomed.
# What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
As mentioned earlier in the post I am tomorrow going to start attending [Crypto College](https://cryptocollege.latecheckout.studio) which I'm really excited about.
