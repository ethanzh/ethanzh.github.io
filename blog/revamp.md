TITLE=Nth Site Revamp

I've done a few different revamps of this site over the years,
and I've just finished the most recent one. I've been thinking
of rewriting my baby static site generator in Rust just for the
heck of it.

My goal going forward is to begin writing more posts on here,
both technical and otherwise. I'll gradually make improvements
but want to keep the minimalist theme I have going.
