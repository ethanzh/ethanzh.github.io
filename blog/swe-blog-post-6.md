# What did you do this past week?
In this past week we finally got a project idea approved for our SWE project! We were able to start working on the implementation of phase one. I had the most fun working on the devops/infra side of things where I was able to employ a lot of the skills I've learnt from working at a small startup.
# What's in your way?
Not much is in my way right now I would say. Probably just an overall lack of time to get everything done that I'd like to, but that's life.
# What will you do next week?
I think deciding on a solid database schema will likely be our biggest challenge in the coming week. This is certainly worth careful deliberation I believe as it is a schema we will be working with for the rest of the semster and I'd rather avoid having to write careful database migrations.
# If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #6: Single Responsibility Principle?
I've read a similar chapter in the Pragmatic Programmer so it was nice to read something on a similar topic from a different source. I agree that it is a very important principal as long as it is employed correctly (read: not overused). Not everything needs to be its own serivce, but I agree that each component of the system should only have one overarching goal.
# What was your experience of factorial, reduce, and operators? (this question will vary, week to week)
Again, I thought it was an interesting deep dive into the behind-the-scenes of Python that one would normally not experience when writing normal code. It was specifially interesting to learn how Python differs from C/C++ in terms of operators not being able to both have side effects and return in the same line.
# What made you happy this week?
This weekend my brother and I drove to Houston for the day to see an Astros game which was fun. I was also happy that I got to spend a lot of time learning more about the internals of Docker which I've always found fascinating.
# What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
[This](https://blog.janestreet.com/putting-the-i-back-in-ide-towards-a-github-explorer/) was an interesting piece I read regarding one company's approach to doing code review within a code editor. Their thesis is that our modern-day "IDEs" are not truly integrated as the name would suggest.
