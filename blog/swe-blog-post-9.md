# What did you do this past week?
We went to town on our project and luckily got a few of the critical blockers out of the way. We finally have all of our data loaded into our RDS instance, however there are still a few small data integrity errors we need to tackle. Currently our setup is highly insecure so I will spend some time making sure all of our AWS components live within a VPC.
# What's in your way?
Flask-Restless-NG is proving to not quite be the miracle cure we thought it would be. It mostly works however there are some edge cases that have caused us to rethink how our models work (I'm not sure which software engineering principle this violates but it's definitely annoying).
# What will you do next week?
Next week we will need to get a lot done on our frontend. None of the logic should be too crazy but I'm just hoping we don't run into a ton of React-specific issues. I think we may also need to implement some Flask endpoints of our own to make some of the frontend work easier (for example we want to avoid the frontend needing to make N API calls when querying for relationships).
# If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #8: Interface Segregation Principle?
I honestly did not get much out of it. I guess everything made sense at a high level but I was definitely getting lost in the weeds when it went into detail. I wish this were written in Python honestly, but I understand Python may lack some of the OOP mechanisms that C++ has.
# What was your experience of functions, closures, and decorators?
It was cool, decorators are cool. I think most people in the Python community are probably first introduced to decorators via Python's route handling functions, which I honestly think is a very easy to understand use case.
# What made you happy this week?
Astros are going to the World Series. I'm going to Game 1 on Tuesday which I'm super excited for.
# What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
I've never been a big cooker at all. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX7kwfE3cJQ) honestly really changed my perspective on cooking from both a health as well as economic perspective. I live alone so cooking isn't necessarily any cheaper than eating out, but it's almost always going to be way healthier.
