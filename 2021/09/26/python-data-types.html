    <h2>CS373 Fall 2021: Ethan Houston</h2>
    <h4>Python data types</h4>

    <h1>What did you do this past week?</h1>
<p>This was a pretty busy week! I got caught up on work which was nice (got a PR merged that was 5 weeks in the making). I've also
started to work on larger projects for other classes, such as Networks. Obviously we are now in the ideation stage for what we
want to work on for our SWE project. Nothing has been super narrowed down yet, but there's a few cool ideas I've been thinking of
that I think could be cool to work on.</p>
<h1>What's in your way?</h1>
<p>I got a concussion early this week so I've had to limit my screen time! Other than that I would say not much is in my way, other than
a conceptual understanding of algebraic structures (probably the hardest class I'm taking this semester).</p>
<h1>What will you do next week?</h1>
<p>Next week we'll hopefully be able to get started on some of the preliminary work for the SWE project. I'm hoping that we have an idea
figured out and approved by early next week.</p>
<h1>If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #5: Pair Programming?</h1>
<p>I thought it made some good points. It also seemed a bit dated in the way it talked about developing software. Overall I have enjoyed
pair programming the few times I have done it properly which has not been in a while so I would be excited to do it again properly
sometime soon.</p>
<h1>What was your experience of Python's object model, list, tuple, set, dict, and iterators?</h1>
<p>I've been using Python for a pretty long time at this point. I was very familiar with the interfaces to these data types but it was
interesting to take a deep-dive into some of the specifics of these types as well as learning <em>why</em> things are implemented in a certain
way compared to Java/C/C++/etc.</p>
<h1>What made you happy this week?</h1>
<p>I got a new car! Spent a good part of Sunday driving around Austin which was nice. I also went to Banger's for Oktoberfest which was a cool
celebration to see.</p>
<h1>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p>I've been familiar with the blockchain ecosystem for a while now, but I've never actually read the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/">Ethereum whitepaper</a>
until now! It's pretty dense but super interesting to see what powers the ETH ecosystem.</p>
