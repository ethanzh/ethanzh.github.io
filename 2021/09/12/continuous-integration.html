    <h2>CS373 Fall 2021: Ethan Houston</h2>
    <h4>Continuous Integration</h4>

    <h1>What did you do this past week?</h1>
<p>This was another pretty routine week for me. I finally started on the Collatz project (a little bit late I know) and am making steady progress on it. I'll certainly start the next one earlier. I also ran the first CTF (capture the flag) competition of the year for the Information and Systems Security Society which I think went very well (except for not ordering enough food!). Also watched the Longhorns sadly lose to Arkansas.</p>
<h1>What's in your way?</h1>
<p>My time management has still been a little lacking since school's started. With a lot more things being in-person it's easier to get distracted and go out and do things rather than stay home and do work. I know there's a healthy middle ground to be found, I'm just still trying to find it. Also my car got towed from my own parking garage which was kind of a drag.</p>
<h1>What will you do next week?</h1>
<p>I think I'm going to try meal-prepping for the first time! Seems like a healthy, cheap, and convenient way to cook everything at once rather than cooking once per meal. I have a lot of room to improve as a chef so we'll see how it goes! I am also going to attempt to be a little bit more diligent in my studies, but still leaving room to enjoy myself.</p>
<h1>If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #3: Continuous Integration?</h1>
<p>I thought it was really interesting how many of the points made still apply today, 15 years after the article was written. There's a little bit of different terminology and names of specific products, but the core message remains the same. As some other commenter's on the paper mentioned, I can't quite imagine what the manual process looks like. I have only ever worked at companies that do CI so it's hard to wrap my head around how you can write and ship software without it.</p>
<h1>What was your experience of IsPrime and Collatz optimizations? (this question will vary, week to week)</h1>
<p>I thought the IsPrime optimizations all made sense, as well as many of the Collatz optimizations. I'm in the process of still optimizing my Collatz implementation, I find it an interesting challenge to fit within both time and size constraints. Specifically I still have yet to implement the MCL cache for ranges of numbers (e.g. 1500-2500), which I believe will finally allow me to pass test 2, and possibly even test 3.</p>
<h1>What made you happy this week?</h1>
<p>I got confirmation that I'll be able to pick up my new car in two weeks so I'm really looking forward to that! I also had a great time watching the football game with the rugby team on a beautiful Saturday evening, even though the outcome of the game wasn't what we were looking for.</p>
<h1>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p><a href="https://future.a16z.com/the-case-for-developer-experience/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;mkt_tok=MzgyLUpaQi03OTgAAAF_akGNs9l-U08bWuKQqOv_J9w_b1Q8YIuhbWUq1SIf9iBPbzd1A1x7Pzw9wXOABNMwUG54eOwD4_ArpWwiMKgZSB8Bk_4Z-mCCk7n_TRj6fQ">This</a> is a fantastic article I came across from venture capital firm A16Z regarding developer experience (DX) and why it should be prioritized within an organization. It really ties into a lot of the stuff we've been talking about in class, such as customizing the Makefile to be more convenient for your workflow.</p>
