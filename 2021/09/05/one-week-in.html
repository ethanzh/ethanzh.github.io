    <h2>CS373 Fall 2021: Ethan Houston</h2>
    <h4>One week in</h4>

    <h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
<p>This week I settled more into my school and work routine. I've been making it a habit to go on campus even for Zoom classes to help give more of a separation between personal time and work time. Having that change of scenery really helps me. I also took my grandma out to eat for her birthday earlier this week which was pleasant. I also ran the kickoff for the Information &amp; Systems Security Society, over which I preside.</p>
<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
<p>Taking two PE classes and being on the rugby team is starting to take a toll on me. Still trying to figure out if doing all three of these is sustainable all semester. Additionally, I did not get as much work done this weekend as I was hoping to. I work remotely for a venture-funded startup and now that I'm on reduced hours a lot more communication needs to be done asynchronously which is a challenge in and of itself.</p>
<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
<p>Next week will be pretty similar to this week. I'll be spending Labor Day at Banger's, my favorite restaurant in Austin.</p>
<h2>If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #2: Makefile?</h2>
<p>I thought it was nice to see what a fully-featured Makefile for a Python project is. Primarily I've only ever dealt with Makefiles in the context of C-based programs, so it's nice seeing the versatility of Makefiles in action. My one concern is that it seems we are using the system-level Python instance for all of our work, rather
than using a virtual environment.</p>
<h2>What was your experience of assertions, unit tests, and coverage? (this question will vary, week to week)</h2>
<p>I have previously used pytest and unittest extensively, but it was nice to get a formal introduction to the tools from an experienced professor. Coverage is something I had heard of but never used directly in a project so I'm excited to be able to add that tool to me repertoire.</p>
<h2>What made you happy this week?</h2>
<p>My apartment complex finally fixed the second elevator. Throughput is way up! Playing rugby again has also made me very happy.</p>
<h2>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2>
<p>The director of AI at Tesla wrote <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2021/06/21/blockchain/">this nice article</a> detailing how Bitcoin transactions work, all within zero-dependency Python. I'm still working my way through it, but I think it would be super valuable for anyone with even a hint of interest in crypto to read.</p>
