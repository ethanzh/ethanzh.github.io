    <h2>CS373 Fall 2021: Ethan Houston</h2>
    <h4>Extends is evil</h4>

    <h1>What did you do this past week?</h1>
<p>This week I actually got a ton of work done at my job which has been really nice because normally I feel perpetually behind while trying to balance coursework and extracirricular activities. We also finished Phase 3 of our project, and honestly it was a little bit of a shitshow. Our Elastic Beanstalk deployment broke at the last moment and the logs made it very unclear what was happening (it turns out that someone forgot to commit a new dependency to our requirements.txt file). I'm a bit frustrated with how hard it is to parse Elastic Beanstalk logs, but I guess you're ideally mean to pipe those logs to CloudWatch or something like that.</p>
<h1>What's in your way?</h1>
<p>I'm pretty sure I have the flu. I woke up at 7am both extremely hot and extremely cold. I've been chugging tons of water today and taking it easy but I still feel generally weak. I'm trying to get a flu test ASAP so I can get the antiviral meds but it has been very difficult to schedule a flu test.</p>
<h1>What will you do next week?</h1>
<p>This next week we are going to refactor the hell out of our codebase, especially the React app. There are definitely places where we copy/pasted code for the sake of speed rather than taking a few moments to form reasonable abstractions. Obviously this could have been solved by working on the project sooner rather than later but I think we all know that somehow always ends up not being the case.</p>
<h1>If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #13: Why Extends Is Evil?</h1>
<p>I prefered this reading to the long-form C++ OOP posts we've been reading the past few weeks. I suppose this essay was very Java-centric, again I would have preferred to read something more focused on Python (which has several ways of implementing interfaces) rather than Java, even though we all know Java from 314.</p>
<h1>What was your experience of SQL?</h1>
<p>I thought the Hackerrank exercises were pretty fun to do. I had already written lots of SQL at my job but I learned a few new things such as USING vs ON when performing joins.</p>
<h1>What made you happy this week?</h1>
<p>We played our final rugby match of the season against UTSA and won 32-30. I only played for the last 10 minutes or so but I had a blast and had several solid tackles and carries, including a jackal (basically stealing the ball fron the other team).</p>
<h1>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p>I thought <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2021/11/09/how-gen-z-and-the-tiktok-generation-are-becoming-spies/">this</a> was an interesting article discussing the CIA attempting to recruit Gen Z'ers. Some really interesting tid bits in there.</p>
