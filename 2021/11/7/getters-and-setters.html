    <h2>CS373 Fall 2021: Ethan Houston</h2>
    <h4>Getters and Setters</h4>

    <h1>What did you do this past week?</h1>
<p>This week I honestly did very little relating to this class. I suppose phase 2 zapped a lot of energy out of us so we wanted to take some time to chill and relax. I did do a lot of reading on my own though which I found rewarding, I've also been taking my running a bit more seriously.</p>
<h1>What's in your way?</h1>
<p>Not a whole lot right now to be hoenst. I think we just need to go ahead and get started on our phase 3 and then everything will be fine, we just haven't taken that first step yet.</p>
<h1>What will you do next week?</h1>
<p>Next week as I said in the previous paragraph we are going to start on phase 3 and divy up work. I don't think it's going to be more difficult than phase 2 certainly so hopefully it is relatively chill but I'm sure things are going to come up that need to be dealt with.</p>
<h1>If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #11: Getters and Setters?</h1>
<p>I thoght this was a much more interesting read than a lot of the essays we read before. This essay was a bit more general and I understood exactly the situations it was talking about whereas the essays we read seemed to use somewhat contrived situations to convey the points they were making.</p>
<h1>What was your experience of relational algebra, select, and project? (this question will vary, week to week)</h1>
<p>I thought it was really cool to do a little bit of a deep dive into these concepts. I'm really into databases and SQL so implementing the under-the-hood operations in python such as select andd project was really cool.</p>
<h1>What made you happy this week?</h1>
<p>The weather has been fantastic I love being able to keep my balcony door open and have nice crisp air all around. I also helped organize Security Day for ISSS which went really well.</p>
<h1>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p>I've been reading more and more about Web 3.0 lately, and I feel like <a href="https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201621266534402?s=20">this</a> Twitter thread is a pretty good intro to people who may have no idea what that means. I'm still a little skeptical but I'm certainly going to try to learn a lot more about it.</p>
