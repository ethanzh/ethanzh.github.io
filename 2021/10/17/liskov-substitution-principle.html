    <h2>CS373 Fall 2021: Ethan Houston</h2>
    <h4>Liskov Substitution Principle</h4>

    <h1>What did you do this past week?</h1>
<p>We got started on phase 2 for the project for this class. Everything is going relatively smoothly so far, we have most of our data scraped, we still just need to finalize our database schema.</p>
<h1>What's in your way?</h1>
<p>Not much really. I'm done with midterms for the time being which is a nice feeling. Unfortunately Baylor's rugby team beat us by several points last Friday. As said we also still need to finalize our database schema before we can proceed to working on other parts of the project.</p>
<h1>What will you do next week?</h1>
<p>Next week I will hopefully get a lot of work done both at my actual work and on phase 2. I think I am also going to take it easy this next week in order to fix my sleep schedule.</p>
<h1>If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #8: Liskov Substitution Principle?</h1>
<p>I thought it was very thorough. It made some interesting points, but I had to re-read parts of it a few times to fully internalize it. I have helped design software systems in the past and do not recall explicitly thinking about the considerations presented in the paper. This article was written using C++, I'm curious what is different about these concepts when applied to Python.</p>
<h1>What was your experience of comprehensions, generators, and yield?</h1>
<p>They're cool. Comprehensions are one of my favorite Python features, as is yield. I really miss them when using other languages (that aren't Haskell). Yield is also pretty neat, but I can't remember the last time I thoguht to use it for something.</p>
<h1>What made you happy this week?</h1>
<p>The cool weather has been fantastic, I've been spending a lot of time outside this past week. It looks like it's going to stay cool throughout the week which I am really looking forward to. I also had fun going out to Banger's with my friend for her birthday on Saturday.</p>
<h1>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p>Disclaimer, I have only skimmed this article so far, but <a href="https://www.softwareatscale.dev/p/software-at-scale-34-faster-python">this</a> talk with Guido seems really interesting and helpful to consider when writing Python.</p>
