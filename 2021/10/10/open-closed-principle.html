    <h2>CS373 Fall 2021: Ethan Houston</h2>
    <h4>Open-Closed Principle</h4>

    <h1>What did you do this past week?</h1>
<p>I did a lot of stuff this week. On Friday I drove to Dallas to play against OU in rugby and then go to the state fair the next day to watch the football game. Then I drove back to Austin to go to ACL which was a blast. I also got my COVID booster shot!</p>
<h1>What's in your way?</h1>
<p>I did not get a ton of my work done as a result of going to OU/ACL. I'm looking forward to getting back on track this week. I also have a few midterms next week which I am hoping will not be too bad.</p>
<h1>What will you do next week?</h1>
<p>As said, i'm going to try to get back into my regular routine. I actually have have a midterm on Monday also which I've hopefully sutdied enough for. Finally, we are going to start actually scraping data from our RESTful APIs to get started on phase 2 of the project.</p>
<h1>If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #7: Open-Closed Principle?</h1>
<p>It was an interesting read but I honestly thought it was pretty straightforward. I think it made some interesting point about dogmatic practices, such as always avoiding global variables no matter what. I'll probably need to read it a few more times to be able to really internalize it.</p>
<h1>What was your experience of operators, and iteration?</h1>
<p>I thought we got pretty in-the-weeds, which was interesting but I've really never had to think about any of these specifics while writing Python code generally. I didn't know about the differneces between iterables and iterators before.</p>
<h1>What made you happy this week?</h1>
<p>I had a ton of fun with my friends in Dallas, and also we beat OU in rugby! Also I finally finished my Networks project which was a stressor in my life. This next week will be even better because I'll be able to get back into my normal routine.</p>
<h1>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.softwareatscale.dev/p/software-at-scale-34-faster-python">This</a> is an intersting interview with the creator of Python discussing ways to increase the speed at which the langauge runs.</p>
