Describe your most meaningful experience(s) and why they matter to you

Although this may be hard to describe as a single well-isolated
'experience', my experience of growing up abroad has been invaluable
to me and I would not trade it for anything.

I was born in Norway to American parents. I moved several times around
Northern Europe before finally moving to Beijing at age 14, and then
Palo Alto at age 17 (I now attend school in Austin).

With this experience (dubbed being a 'Third Culture Kid') I was able
to interact with and make friends with a wide variety of people I
never would have been able to if I had grown up in a single place.

Above all else this experience has given me a deep understanding of
empathy. Applying a typical Euro-centric viewpoint of the world is
in my mind a deeply flawed approach, but it's something I see in the
Western media every day.

Being uprooted from my life every ~three years also taught me how
to adapt to new circumstances (albeit out of necessity). This matters
to me because it's forced me to always live in the moment and to
not take anything for granted.

This experience was so formative for myself that I am very inclined
to give my children a similar experience when that time comes.

I think a lot of the world's problems would be solved if we just
understood one another better.
