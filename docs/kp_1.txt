What impact do you want to have on the world and why?

As cliche as it is, I want to leave the world a better
place than I found it.

When I came to university I had a far different definition
of success than I do now. My definition of success was
getting a job at a company a lot of people had heard of and
to make a lot of money. Although I understand the reasoning
behind these sorts of aspirations I feel differently
now.

Now, I'm far more interested in working on and building
things that make people's lives better - even slightly.
However, I don't want the only impact I leave on this
world to be some material piece of software I make. I
think even more important than building cool things is to
maintain strong, healthy relationships with those closest to
me, and making other people feel good about themselves.

I think in this field it's very easy to almost go into
auto-pilot mode, progressing through the ranks of a company,
heading towards some definition of success that as said
previously I don't totally agree with. I think with a
conscious effort I can combine this ambition with my desire
to better the lives of others.

I also wish my running times on Strava would leave an impact
on the Strava leaderboards, but that might be wishful
thinking coming from me :)
